1. **Skill Verification System:**

   - **Objective:** Verify users' skills through anonymous peer review using blockchain technology.
   - **Name:** VeriSkill(VSkill)

2. **Mechanism:**

   - Users submit evidence of their skills.
   - Evidence is distributed to anonymous verifiers within the same domain using a decentralized oracle system.
   - Verifiers assess the evidence and provide feedback.

3. **Rewards and Penalties:**

   - **Rewards:** Verifiers who provide accurate and honest feedback receive rewards (tokens).
   - **Penalties:** Verifiers who act maliciously or provide inaccurate feedback are penalized (reduced tokens or other penalties).
   - **Reputation System:** A decentralized reputation protocol adjusts verifier rewards and penalties based on historical performance and community feedback.

4. **Staking:**

   - Verifiers are required to stake tokens to participate in the verification process.
   - Staking ensures verifiers are committed and deters malicious behavior.
   - A quadratic staking model is used to cap the influence of large token holders.

5. **Incentive Structure:**

   - Issue tokens to incentivize participation in the system.
   - Tokens can be used to increase chances of being selected as a verifier.
   - Implement a dynamic token issuance model to balance the token economy, including periodic token burns or buybacks.

6. **NFT Issuance:**
   - Verified users receive an NFT as proof of their skills.
   - The NFT serves as a digital credential that can be used across platforms.
   - Integrate NFTs with other platforms and services where verified skills are valuable (e.g., job boards, freelance platforms).

### To-Do List

1. **Define Requirements:**

   - Determine the specific skills to be verified.
   - Outline the criteria for evidence submission and verification.

2. **Design the Mechanism:**

   - Create a process for submitting and verifying evidence.
   - Develop a method for distributing evidence to verifiers anonymously using decentralized oracles.

3. **Establish Rewards and Penalties:**

   - Define the criteria for rewarding accurate verifiers.
   - Develop a penalty system for malicious or inaccurate verifiers.
   - Implement a decentralized reputation protocol to adjust rewards and penalties.

4. **Implement Staking:**

   - Determine the amount of tokens required for staking.
   - Define the rules for staking, including how stakes influence verifier selection.
   - Introduce a quadratic staking model to limit the influence of large token holders.

5. **Create an Incentive Structure:**

   - Develop a token issuance plan to incentivize participation.
   - Ensure the token distribution prevents centralization of power.
   - Implement a dynamic token issuance model to manage the token economy.

6. **Develop NFT Issuance:**

   - Design the NFTs to be issued as proof of skills.
   - Define the criteria for receiving an NFT upon successful verification.
   - Partner with existing platforms to integrate NFTs as recognized credentials.
