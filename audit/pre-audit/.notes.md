## Private key better solution

- Instead of add `.env` file, we can use [ERC-2335: BLS12-381 Keystore ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) to encrypt the private key into a JSON format.
- Here is how it goes:

  1. Let's pretend the private key is the default anvil key: `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
  2. Then pull up the terminal and run the following command:

  ```bash
      cast wallet import YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME --interactive
  ```

  Here I would call it `defaultKey`, and a interactive prompt will show as below:

  ```bash
      Enter private key:
      Enter password:
      `your-account-name` keystore was saved successfully. Address: address-corresponding-to-private-key
  ```

  Please keep in mind the password you entered, this will be needed for you moving forward with the private key.

  3. Now you have the private key stored, and you can check it by running the following command:

  ```bash
      cast wallet list
  ```

  You will see the `defaultKey` in the list.

  4. Now instead of the older command in the `Makefile`:

  ```bash
      forge script script/staking/DeployStaking.s.sol:DeployStaking --rpc-url $(ANVIL_RPC_URL) --private-key $(ANVIL_PRIVATE_KEY) --broadcast -vvvv
  ```

  We can use the following command(`0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` is the address corresponding to the private key):

  ```bash
      forge script script/staking/DeployStaking.s.sol:DeployStaking --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --account defaultKey --sender 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 --broadcast -vvvv
  ```

  5. Then it will ask you for the keystore password, enter the password you set in step 2.

  ```bash
    Enter keystore password:
  ```

  6. Now you have successfully deployed the contract with the private key encrypted in the keystore.
  7. Instead of adding the `.env` file where you place the private key there and may accidentally exposed to others, now you may create a `.password` file and just store that keystore password there.

- If you go to your home directory, you can run the command:

```bash
cd .foundry/keystores/
ls
```

You can find your keystore there.

And of course you can see what's in there:

```bash
cat defaultKey
```

It will just display a encrypted JSON format of the private key.

## How to generate a PDF report file

1. Add all your findings to a markdown file like `report.md`
   1. Add the metadata you see at the top of that file
2. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) & [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
   1. You might also have to install [one more package](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/issues/141) if you get `File 'footnotebackref.sty' not found.`
3. Download `eisvogel.latex` and add to your templates directory (should be `~/.pandoc/templates/`)
4. Add your logo to the directory as a pdf named `logo.pdf`
5. Run this command:

```bash
pandoc report.md -o report.pdf --from markdown --template=eisvogel --listings
```

or

```bash
pandoc report.md -o report.pdf --from markdown --template=eisvogel --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

Certain characters like `â †` do not work with pandoc, and you'll need to remove them to generate your final report.
